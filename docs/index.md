ShellHub is a modern SSH server for remotely accessing Linux devices
via command line (using any SSH client) or web-based user interface.
It is intended to be used instead of sshd.

Typically, if you want to SSH into a Linux device on a local network,
you just need to know its IP address.
However, in order to access a Linux device from outside the local network,
you usually need to jump a lot of laps, such as getting its public IP
address and adjusting some settings on the home router.
Changing the VPN/firewall configuration can be cumbersome if the device
is behind a corporate firewall that does not allow SSH connections.

ShellHub provide a way to skill all the hasless. You can easily access
any Linux device behind firewall and NAT.
