In order to register a device on ShellHub, you need to install
ShellHub agent onto it.

The easiest way to install ShellHub agent is with our automatic one-line installation script, which works with all Linux distributions that have Docker installed and properly set up.

The other way to install ShellHub agent is build it from the source code by yourself or if you are targeting embedded devices checkout our [Yocto Project support layer for ShellHub](https://github.com/shellhub-io/meta-shellhub).

## One-line installation script (Docker)

Open the ShellHub UI, navigate to _Devices_ on the sidebar, and click on _ADD DEVICE_. It should give you a registration command that you can run on your device:

After your device is enrolled, it becomes available in _Devices_ page.
